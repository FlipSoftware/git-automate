  # Git Automate
  
</div>

Git Automate is a powerful and versatile tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of semantically versioning your `git` development using the Semantic Versioning (`SemVer`) standard. Whether you prefer to interact through a command-line interface (CLI) or an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), Git Automate offers the best of both worlds.

> [!NOTE]
> # Purpose
> Git Automate helps developers track changes, identify what affects the codebase, and improve its quality. It's all about building better software and contributing to projects in an efficient and meaningful way.

# [Features]()

- **[Interactive CLI]()**: Git Automate offers a feature-rich command-line interface that allows you to easily control and manage your versioning process through simple commands and prompts.

- **[Responsive GUI]()**: For those who prefer a visual approach, the responsive and intuitive graphical user interface provides a user-friendly way to manage versioning with just a few clicks.

- **[Semantic Versioning Made Easy]()**: Git Automate follows the `SemVer` principles, enabling you to seamlessly manage version numbers for your software projects.

- **[Automated Version Bumping]()**: Say goodbye to manual version updates. Git Automate automates the version bumping process based on the nature of your changes (major, minor, or patch).

- **[Git Integration]()**: Built-in Git integration ensures that versioning is seamlessly integrated into your development workflow.

- **[Release Notes Generation]()**: Git Automate generates comprehensive release notes through the `CHANGELOG` option, summarizing the changes between versions, making communication clear.
